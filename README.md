## "Molecular phylogeny of raptors (Accipitriformes vs. Falconiformes): Do mitochondrial and nuclear markers agree with classical taxonomy?"

**Main question** 
Do mitochondrial (*ND1*) and nuclear (*ODC*) markers, together with a functional gene (*SWS1*), support the classical taxonomy that groups eagles (*Accipitriformes*) and falcons (*Falconiformes*) as sister orders?

## **Genes Analyzed**
| Gene      | Type          | Function                                  | Study Relevance                          |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **ND1**   | Mitochondrial | NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1             | High variability for species/genus-level relationships. |
| **ODC**    | Nuclear       | Ornithine decarboxylase                  | Resolves deep nodes (families/orders).   |
| **SWS1**  | Functional    | Short-wave opsin (UV/blue vision)        | Explores visual adaptations in diurnal raptors. |

## **Context and Significance**

- **Taxonomic controversy:** Recent genomic studies suggest *Falconiformes* may be closer to parrots (*Psittaciformes*) than to *Accipitriformes*.
- **Evolutionary importance:**  
  - Raptors are key models for studying adaptive convergence (e.g., talons, vision).  
  - Conflicts between mitochondrial and nuclear genes may reveal historical hybridization or differential natural selection.  
- **Applications:** Conservation, understanding predatory adaptations.

# Programs needed 

* MUSCLE (MUSCLE is a program for creating multiple alignments of amino acid or nucleotide sequences).
* Datasets (Takes the NCBI [The National Center for Biotechnology Information] data for the proyect).
* Iqtree (Program used for doing phylogenies).
* FigTree (Designed as a graphical viewer of phylogenetic trees and as a program for producing publication-ready figures).
